# hello-world

Hi People.

Felipe Meireles here, I currently work in the area of ​​telecommunications network infrastructure, however, I am looking to migrate from area to Full-Stack development. I have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, Wordpress, Javascript and Python. I want to go deeper in the area because I believe that the future will be this one. I am very interested in learning, I am self-taught and highly curious.
